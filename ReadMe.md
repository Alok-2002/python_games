## Dice Rolling Game

The Dice Rolling Game is a simple game where the player rolls two dice and tries to get a higher total than the computer. The game uses the `random` module to simulate the dice rolls.

## KBC Quiz Game

The KBC Quiz Game is a quiz game based on the popular Indian TV show "Kaun Banega Crorepati" (Who Wants to Be a Millionaire). The game asks the player multiple choice questions and gives them four options to choose from. The game uses the `random` module to select the questions from a list of pre-defined questions.

## Tic Tac Toe

The Tic Tac Toe game is a classic game where two players take turns placing X's and O's on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three in a row wins the game. The game uses the Pygame library to draw the game board and handle player input.

## Snake Game

The Snake Game is a classic game where the player controls a snake that grows longer as it eats food. The goal of the game is to eat as much food as possible without crashing into the walls or the snake's own body. The game uses the Pygame library to draw the game board and handle player input.

## Rock Paper Scissor

The Rock Paper Scissor game is a classic game where two players choose between rock, paper, and scissors. Rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, and scissors beats paper. The game uses the `random` module to randomly select the computer's choice.
